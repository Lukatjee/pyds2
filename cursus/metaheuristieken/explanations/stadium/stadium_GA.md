Sure, let's dive into the genetic algorithm (GA) you've implemented for the stadium problem and explain why a custom mutator is used instead of the default `ec.variators.gaussian_mutation`.

### Explanation of the Genetic Algorithm (GA)

1. **Generating Initial Population:**
   The `generate_stadium` function creates an initial population of candidate solutions. Each candidate solution is represented as a list of two values: `L` (length) and `B` (breadth). Both values are initialized such that their sum is 200, adhering to the problem's constraint.

   ```python
   def generate_stadium(random, args):
       L = random.uniform(60, 140)  # Starting closer to expected optimal values
       B = 200 - L
       return [L, B]
   ```

2. **Evaluating Fitness:**
   The `evaluate_stadium` function calculates the fitness of each candidate solution. The fitness is the area of the stadium, `L * B`, but it checks the constraint `L + B = 200`. If the constraint is violated, a very low fitness value (`-1e10`) is assigned to that candidate to ensure it is not selected.

   ```python
   def evaluate_stadium(candidates, args):
       fitness = []
       for candidate in candidates:
           L, B = candidate
           if abs(L + B - 200) < 1e-6:  # Ensure the constraint is strictly met
               fitness.append(L * B)  # Objective function to maximize area
           else:
               fitness.append(float('-1e10'))  # Penalize invalid solutions
       return fitness
   ```

3. **Custom Mutator:**
   The `custom_mutator` function introduces small random changes (mutations) to the candidate solutions while ensuring the constraint `L + B = 200` is maintained. It uses a Gaussian mutation with a smaller standard deviation for finer adjustments.

   ```python
   def custom_mutator(random, candidates, args):
       for candidate in candidates:
           if random.random() < args.get('mutation_rate', 0.1):
               idx = random.randint(0, 1)
               candidate[idx] += random.gauss(0, 5)  # Apply Gaussian mutation with smaller std deviation
               candidate[idx] = max(0, min(candidate[idx], 200))  # Ensure within bounds
               candidate[1 - idx] = 200 - candidate[idx]  # Adjust the other variable to meet the constraint
       return candidates
   ```

4. **Genetic Algorithm Setup:**
   The genetic algorithm (GA) is set up using the `inspyred` library. Various components of the GA are configured, including:
   - **Terminator:** The condition to stop the evolution, based on the number of evaluations.
   - **Variators:** Functions for crossover and mutation.
   - **Observer:** Function to observe the evolution process.

   ```python
   # Random number generator
   rand = Random()

   # Genetic Algorithm setup
   ga = ec.GA(rand)
   ga.terminator = ec.terminators.evaluation_termination
   ga.variator = [ec.variators.n_point_crossover, custom_mutator]
   ga.observer = ec.observers.plot_observer
   ```

5. **Evolving the Population:**
   The `evolve` method is called to run the genetic algorithm. It uses the generator and evaluator functions defined earlier, along with other parameters like population size, maximum evaluations, and mutation rate.

   ```python
   # Evolve population
   population = ga.evolve(
       generator=generate_stadium,
       evaluator=evaluate_stadium,
       pop_size=600,
       maximize=True,
       bounder=ec.Bounder([0, 0], [200, 200]),
       max_evaluations=20000,
       mutation_rate=0.1  # Lower mutation rate for more controlled changes
   )
   ```

6. **Sorting and Printing the Best Solution:**
   After evolution, the population is sorted based on fitness in descending order, and the best solution is printed.

   ```python
   # Sort population based on fitness in descending order
   population.sort(reverse=True)

   # Print optimal solution and its fitness value
   optimal_solution = population[0].candidate
   optimal_value = population[0].fitness

   print(f"Optimal solution: L={optimal_solution[0]}, B={optimal_solution[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
   ```

### Custom Mutator vs. Default Gaussian Mutation

**Custom Mutator:**
- **Purpose:** The custom mutator ensures that after mutation, the constraint `L + B = 200` is always maintained. This is done by adjusting one dimension (either `L` or `B`) and then updating the other dimension to satisfy the constraint.
- **Fine Adjustments:** The mutation step is small (`random.gauss(0, 5)`) to allow finer adjustments, which helps in exploring the solution space more precisely.
- **Bounds:** The mutator also ensures that the mutated values remain within the valid range [0, 200].

**Default `ec.variators.gaussian_mutation`:**
- The default Gaussian mutation in `inspyred` does not inherently respect specific problem constraints. It applies a Gaussian mutation to each element independently, which can result in invalid solutions that do not satisfy `L + B = 200`.
- It doesn't adjust the other variable to maintain the constraint, making it less suitable for problems where such constraints must be strictly met.

### Why Use a Custom Mutator?

Using a custom mutator allows you to:
1. **Respect Constraints:** Ensure that every mutated candidate solution always satisfies the problem constraints.
2. **Controlled Adjustments:** Apply finer, controlled adjustments to the candidate solutions, improving the search process's precision.
3. **Problem-Specific Adjustments:** Tailor the mutation process to the specific needs of the problem, improving the chances of finding an optimal solution.

By using a custom mutator, you can better control the evolutionary process and ensure that the genetic algorithm generates valid and high-quality solutions for the stadium problem.

### Full Code Example

```python
import random
from random import Random
from inspyred import ec

def generate_stadium(random, args):
    # Generate a random length L, ensuring that B = 200 - L
    L = random.uniform(60, 140)  # Starting closer to expected optimal values
    B = 200 - L
    return [L, B]

def evaluate_stadium(candidates, args):
    fitness = []
    for candidate in candidates:
        L, B = candidate
        if abs(L + B - 200) < 1e-6:  # Ensure the constraint is strictly met
            fitness.append(L * B)  # Objective function to maximize area
        else:
            fitness.append(float('-1e10'))  # Penalize invalid solutions
    return fitness

def custom_mutator(random, candidates, args):
    for candidate in candidates:
        if random.random() < args.get('mutation_rate', 0.1):
            idx = random.randint(0, 1)
            candidate[idx] += random.gauss(0, 5)  # Apply Gaussian mutation with smaller std deviation
            candidate[idx] = max(0, min(candidate[idx], 200))  # Ensure within bounds
            candidate[1 - idx] = 200 - candidate[idx]  # Adjust the other variable to meet the constraint
    return candidates

# Random number generator
rand = Random()

# Genetic Algorithm setup
ga = ec.GA(rand)
ga.terminator = ec.terminators.evaluation_termination
ga.variator = [ec.variators.n_point_crossover, custom_mutator]
ga.observer = ec.observers.plot_observer

# Evolve population
population = ga.evolve(
    generator=generate_stadium,
    evaluator=evaluate_stadium,
    pop_size=600,
    maximize=True,
    bounder=ec.Bounder([0, 0], [200, 200]),
    max_evaluations=20000,
    mutation_rate=0.1  # Lower mutation rate for more controlled changes
)

# Sort population based on fitness in descending order
population.sort(reverse=True)

# Print optimal solution and its fitness value
optimal_solution = population[0].candidate
optimal_value = population[0].fitness

print(f"Optimal solution: L={optimal_solution[0]}, B={optimal_solution[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
```

This code effectively implements a genetic algorithm to solve the stadium problem, ensuring the constraints are met and optimizing the area of the stadium.
