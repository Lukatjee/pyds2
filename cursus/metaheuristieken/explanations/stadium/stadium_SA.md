Sure! Let's walk through your Simulated Annealing implementation for the Stadium problem step by step.

### Problem Description

The goal is to find the dimensions (length `L` and breadth `B`) of a stadium such that the area (`L * B`) is maximized, with the constraint that `L + B = 200`.

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition:**
   The `StadiumProblem` class inherits from the `Annealer` class, which is part of the `simanneal` package. This class defines the specific problem we want to solve using simulated annealing.

   ```python
   class StadiumProblem(Annealer):
       def __init__(self, state):
           super(StadiumProblem, self).__init__(state)
   ```

2. **Move Function:**
   The `move` function introduces a small random change to the state (i.e., the dimensions `L` and `B`). The mutation step is a small adjustment (`delta`), and the constraint `L + B = 200` is maintained by adjusting both `L` and `B` accordingly.
   
   ```python
   def move(self):
       # Randomly change the length or breadth while keeping the constraint L + B = 200
       idx = np.random.randint(len(self.state))
       if idx == 0:
           delta = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)  # Smaller mutation step for finer adjustments
           self.state[0] = max(0, min(self.state[0] + delta, 200))
           self.state[1] = 200 - self.state[0]
       else:
           delta = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)  # Smaller mutation step for finer adjustments
           self.state[1] = max(0, min(self.state[1] + delta, 200))
           self.state[0] = 200 - self.state[1]
   ```

   **Explanation of the Move Function:**
   - `idx = np.random.randint(len(self.state))` randomly selects either the length (`L`, index 0) or the breadth (`B`, index 1) to modify.
   - If `idx == 0`, the length `L` is adjusted by a small random amount `delta`, ensuring it remains within the range [0, 200]. The breadth `B` is then set to maintain the constraint `L + B = 200`.
   - If `idx == 1`, the breadth `B` is adjusted similarly, and the length `L` is adjusted to maintain the constraint.

3. **Energy Function:**
   The `energy` function evaluates the current state. Since we want to maximize the area (`L * B`), we minimize the negative of the area.

   ```python
   def energy(self):
       L, B = self.state
       return -1 * (L * B)  # Maximize area by minimizing the negative of the area
   ```

4. **Initial State:**
   The initial state is set to [100, 100], which is a reasonable starting point given the constraint `L + B = 200`.

   ```python
   initial_state = [100, 100]  # Start closer to the expected optimal values
   ```

5. **Simulated Annealing:**
   The `StadiumProblem` instance is created with the initial state. The annealing process is configured with the number of steps, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.

   ```python
   stadium = StadiumProblem(initial_state)
   stadium.steps = 10000  # Number of steps
   stadium.Tmax = 25000.0  # Max temperature
   stadium.Tmin = 2.5  # Min temperature
   ```

6. **Running the Annealing Process:**
   The `anneal` method is called to start the simulated annealing process. It returns the best state found and its energy. The objective function value is the negative of the energy since we minimized `-1 * (L * B)`.

   ```python
   state, energy = stadium.anneal()
   optimal_value = -energy

   print(f"Optimal solution: L={state[0]}, B={state[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
   ```

### Full Example with Clarifications

Here's the complete code with comments to make each part clear:

```python
import numpy as np
from simanneal import Annealer

class StadiumProblem(Annealer):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super(StadiumProblem, self).__init__(state)
    
    def move(self):
        # Randomly change the length or breadth while keeping the constraint L + B = 200
        idx = np.random.randint(len(self.state))
        if idx == 0:
            # Change length L
            delta = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)  # Small mutation step for fine adjustments
            self.state[0] = max(0, min(self.state[0] + delta, 200))
            self.state[1] = 200 - self.state[0]  # Adjust breadth B to maintain L + B = 200
        else:
            # Change breadth B
            delta = np.random.uniform(-5, 5)  # Small mutation step for fine adjustments
            self.state[1] = max(0, min(self.state[1] + delta, 200))
            self.state[0] = 200 - self.state[1]  # Adjust length L to maintain L + B = 200
    
    def energy(self):
        L, B = self.state
        return -1 * (L * B)  # Maximize area by minimizing the negative of the area

# Initial state
initial_state = [100, 100]  # Start closer to the expected optimal values

# Simulated Annealing
stadium = StadiumProblem(initial_state)
stadium.steps = 10000  # Number of steps
stadium.Tmax = 25000.0  # Max temperature
stadium.Tmin = 2.5  # Min temperature

# Run the annealing process
state, energy = stadium.anneal()
optimal_value = -energy  # Convert energy back to positive value for the area

print(f"Optimal solution: L={state[0]}, B={state[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
```

### Key Points

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial state is set to `[100, 100]` to start with a reasonable guess.

2. **Move Function:**
   - Introduces a small random change to either `L` or `B` while keeping the constraint `L + B = 200`.

3. **Energy Function:**
   - Calculates the "energy" as the negative of the area to convert the maximization problem into a minimization problem.

4. **Simulated Annealing Process:**
   - The annealing process gradually reduces the temperature to explore the solution space efficiently and find the optimal solution while escaping local minima.

By running this code, you are performing simulated annealing to find the optimal dimensions for the stadium that maximize the area while respecting the constraint `L + B = 200`.
