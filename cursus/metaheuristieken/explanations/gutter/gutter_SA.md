Sure, let's walk through the Simulated Annealing (SA) solution for the gutter problem using your provided code.

### Explanation

1. **Class Definition:**
   The `GutterProblem` class inherits from `Annealer`, which is part of the `simanneal` package. This class defines the specific problem we want to solve using simulated annealing.

   ```python
   class GutterProblem(Annealer):
       def __init__(self, state):
           super(GutterProblem, self).__init__(state)
   ```

2. **Move Function:**
   The `move` function makes a small change to the current state. Here, it randomly selects one of the dimensions (H or B) and assigns it a new random value between 0 and 1.

   ```python
   def move(self):
       idx = np.random.randint(len(self.state))
       self.state[idx] = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
   ```

3. **Energy Function:**
   The `energy` function evaluates the current state. The goal is to minimize the energy, which is why we return `-1 * (H * B)`. If the constraint `H + B + H > 1` is violated, a high energy value (`float('inf')`) is returned to penalize the solution.

   ```python
   def energy(self):
       H, B = self.state
       if H + B + H > 1:
           return float('inf')
       return -1 * (H * B)
   ```

4. **Initial State:**
   An initial random state is generated.

   ```python
   initial_state = [np.random.uniform(0, 1), np.random.uniform(0, 1)]
   ```

5. **Simulated Annealing:**
   The `GutterProblem` instance is created with the initial state. The annealing process is configured with the number of steps, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.

   ```python
   gutter = GutterProblem(initial_state)
   gutter.steps = 10000  # Number of steps
   gutter.Tmax = 25000.0  # Max temperature
   gutter.Tmin = 2.5  # Min temperature
   ```

6. **Running the Annealing Process:**
   The `anneal` method is called to start the simulated annealing process. It returns the best state found and its energy. The objective function value is the negative of the energy since we minimized `-1 * (H * B)`.

   ```python
   state, energy = gutter.anneal()
   optimal_value = -energy

   print(f"Optimal solution: H={state[0]}, B={state[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
   ```

### Full Example with Clarifications

Here is the complete code for solving the gutter problem using simulated annealing:

```python
import numpy as np
from simanneal import Annealer

class GutterProblem(Annealer):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super(GutterProblem, self).__init__(state)
    
    def move(self):
        idx = np.random.randint(len(self.state))
        self.state[idx] = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
    
    def energy(self):
        H, B = self.state
        if H + B + H > 1:
            return float('inf')
        return -1 * (H * B)

# Initial state
initial_state = [np.random.uniform(0, 1), np.random.uniform(0, (1 - np.random.uniform(0, 1)) / 2)]

# Simulated Annealing
gutter = GutterProblem(initial_state)
gutter.steps = 10000  # Number of steps
gutter.Tmax = 25000.0  # Max temperature
gutter.Tmin = 2.5  # Min temperature

state, energy = gutter.anneal()
optimal_value = -energy

print(f"Optimal solution: H={state[0]}, B={state[1]}\nObjective function value: {optimal_value}")
```

### Explanation of the Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial state is a random pair `[H, B]` where `H` and `B` are both initialized randomly within the range `[0, 1]`. To ensure the initial state is valid, you might want to initialize `H` such that it always satisfies `H + 2B <= 1`.

2. **Move Function:**
   - `move` function introduces a small random change to one of the dimensions of the state (either `H` or `B`). This helps in exploring the solution space.

3. **Energy Function:**
   - The `energy` function calculates the "energy" of the current state, which we want to minimize. If the constraint `H + 2B > 1` is violated, it assigns a very high energy to penalize the solution. Otherwise, it returns the negative area of the gutter because we want to maximize the area.

4. **Simulated Annealing Process:**
   - `anneal` method performs the simulated annealing process by gradually lowering the temperature and accepting new states based on the probability that depends on the current temperature and the difference in energy. The goal is to escape local minima and find a global optimum.

By running the code, you are performing simulated annealing to find the optimal dimensions for the gutter that maximize the area while respecting the constraint `H + 2B <= 1`.
